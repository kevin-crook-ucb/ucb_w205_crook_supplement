# Kevin Crook's week 7 synchronous session supplemental notes

Overview of today's synch session:
* Everyone attempt to login and use their Digital Ocean droplet.  Separate instructions are provided so they can be referred to in the future.  Some students may not be able to use them due to blocked ports or admin rights to run PuTTY.
* Review assignments 6, 7, and 8
* Activity 1:
  * Purpose: last week, we created a kafka topic, published numbers to the topic, and then consumed the numbers from the topic using core python.  In this activity, we are doing the same thing, except instead of reading using core python, we will be using spark via the python interface called pyspark.
  * Create a docker cluster with 4 containers: zookeeper, kafka, mids, and spark.
  * Create a kafka topic and publish the numbers 1 to 42 to that topic
  * Start pyspark (python spark interface in the spark container) and write spark code in python to consume the messages from the topic
  * tear down the cluster
* Activity 2:
  * Purpose: last week, we created a kafka topic, published json data to the topic, and then consumed the json data using core python with pandas.  In this activity, we are doing the same thing, except instead of using core python with pandas, we will be using spark via the python interface called pyspark.
  * Same docker cluster as above.
  * Pull down a json format file of GitHub data
  * Create a kafka topic and publish the GitHub data to the topic
  * Start pyspark and write spark code in python to consume the messages from the topic and place them into a spark data frame which is built using a spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset).  An RDD is essentially a parallel list.
  * Do some manipulations to filter and format the data in the spark data frame.
  * tear down the cluster
  
## Activity 1

Create a directory for spark with kafka and change to that directory:
```
mkdir ~/w205/spark-with-kafka
cd ~/w205/spark-with-kafka
```

Copy the yml file to the spark with kafka directory we should be in:
```
cp ~/w205/course-content/07-Sourcing-Data/docker-compose.yml .
```

Edit the yml file we just copied.  During class we will talk through it.  For volume mounts, you may need to change them to fully qualified path names.  If you are running Windows desktop, you will need to change them to a fully qualified Windows path.

Start the docker cluster:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to see the kafka logs live as it comes up use the following command. The -f tells it to keep checking the file for any new additions to the file and print them.  To stop this command, use a control-C: 
```
docker-compose logs -f kafka
```

Create a topic called foo in the kafka container using the kafka-topics utility:
```
docker-compose exec kafka \
  kafka-topics \
    --create \
    --topic foo \
    --partitions 1 \
    --replication-factor 1 \
    --if-not-exists \
    --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --create --topic foo --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --if-not-exists --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

You should see the following message to let us know the topic foo was created correctly:
```
Created topic "foo".
```

Check the topic in the kafka container using the kafka-topics utility:
```
docker-compose exec kafka \
  kafka-topics \
  --describe \
  --topic foo \
  --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --describe --topic foo --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

You should see the following or similar output from the previous command:
```
Topic:foo   PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:1 Configs:
Topic: foo  Partition: 0    Leader: 1    Replicas: 1  Isr: 1
```

Now that we have the topic created in kafka, we want to publish the numbers from 1 to 42 to that topic.  We use the kafka container with the kafka-console-producer utility:
```
docker-compose exec kafka \
  bash -c "seq 42 | kafka-console-producer \
    --request-required-acks 1 \
    --broker-list kafka:29092 \
    --topic foo && echo 'Produced 42 messages.'"
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec kafka bash -c "seq 42 | kafka-console-producer --request-required-acks 1 --broker-list kafka:29092 --topic foo && echo 'Produced 42 messages.'"
```

You should see the following or similar output from the previous command:
```
Produced 42 messages.
```

Previously, we used two methods to consume messages from the topic:
* the kafka-console-consumer utility
* the kafkacat utility

Instead of using those utilities, we are going to use spark to consume the messages.

In the spark container, run the python spark command line utility called pyspark:
```
docker-compose exec spark pyspark
```

Using pyspark, we will write some python spark code to consume from the kafka topic. numbers will be a spark data frame which is built on top of a spark RDD:
```
numbers = spark \
  .read \
  .format("kafka") \
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:29092") \
  .option("subscribe","foo") \
  .option("startingOffsets", "earliest") \
  .option("endingOffsets", "latest") \
  .load() 
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
numbers = spark.read.format("kafka").option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:29092").option("subscribe","foo").option("startingOffsets", "earliest").option("endingOffsets", "latest").load() 
```

Print the schema for the data frame.  Note that the values are shown in binary, which we as humans have a hard time reading.:
```
numbers.printSchema()
```

Since we have a hard time reading binary for the value, let's translate the key and value into strings so we can read them.  Create a new data frame which stores the numbers as strings.  Note the data frames are immutable, so we cannot change them in place, we have to make a copy:
```
numbers_as_strings=numbers.selectExpr("CAST(key AS STRING)", "CAST(value AS STRING)")
```

Use some of the methods of the data frame to display various things:

Display the entire data frame.  Note that now we can read the key and value:
```
numbers_as_strings.show()
```

Display the schema for the data frame:
```
numbers_as_strings.printSchema()
```

Display the number of items in the data frame:
```
numbers_as_strings.count()
```

Exit pyspark using:
```
exit()
```

Tear down the docker cluster:
```
docker-compose down
```

Verify the docker cluster is down:
```
docker-compose ps
```

## Activity 2

Download our GitHub example data from the Internet using the curl utility.  Note that since it's using HTTPS, you can paste the URL into a web browser to test if the download works or not.  This is always highly recommended.  It should produce a json file.  However, if there are any errors, it will produce an XML file:
```
cd ~/w205
curl -L -o github-example-large.json https://goo.gl/Hr6erG
```

Continue in our same directory with the same yml file:
```
cd ~/w205/spark-with-kafka
```

Start the docker cluster (same as we did before):
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Check the kafka logs (same as we did before) Remember to hit the control-C to exit:
```
docker-compose logs -f kafka
```

Create a topic called foo (same as we did before):
```
docker-compose exec kafka \
  kafka-topics \
    --create \
	  --topic foo \
	  --partitions 1 \
	  --replication-factor 1 \
	  --if-not-exists \
	  --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --create --topic foo --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --if-not-exists --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

You should see the following message to let us know the topic foo was created correctly:
```
Created topic "foo".
```

Check the topic (same as we did before):
```
docker-compose exec kafka \
  kafka-topics \
    --describe \
    --topic foo \
    --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --describe --topic foo --zookeeper zookeeper:32181
```

You should see the following or similar output from the previous command:
```
Topic:foo   PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:1 Configs:
Topic: foo  Partition: 0    Leader: 1    Replicas: 1  Isr: 1
```

We will execute a bash shell commands in the mids container as microservices.  Remember with microservices, we start a container, run one command, and then exit the container when the command completes.  In the first one, we just print out the json file as is.  In the second one, we print out the json file and pipe it to the utility jq for formatting.  Try running these in different windows and compare the results:
```
docker-compose exec mids bash -c "cat /w205/github-example-large.json"
docker-compose exec mids bash -c "cat /w205/github-example-large.json | jq '.'"
```

One thing I find strange about json files is that we are not allowed to just have a file of json objects.  We have to place a wrapper around the json objects that consists of an open square bracket at the beginning of the file, comma separated json objects, and a close square bracket at the end of the file.  The following command uses jq to remove this outer wrapper.  It also uses a compact format which is good for computers, but hard for humans to read.  Try running this command if a different window and compare it side by side with the previous two commands:
```
docker-compose exec mids bash -c "cat /w205/github-example-large.json | jq '.[]' -c"
```

Execute a bash shell in the mids container to run a microservice.  The cat piped into jq, we are already familiar with from the previous command.  We add a step to pipe it into the kafkacat utility with the -P option.  The -P option tells it to publish messages.  The -t options gives it the topic name of foo.  The kafka:29092 tells it the container name and the port number where kafka is running.
```
docker-compose exec mids \
  bash -c "cat /w205/github-example-large.json \
    | jq '.[]' -c \
    | kafkacat -P -b kafka:29092 -t foo && echo 'Produced 100 messages.'"
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easier to copy and paste:
```
docker-compose exec mids bash -c "cat /w205/github-example-large.json | jq '.[]' -c | kafkacat -P -b kafka:29092 -t foo && echo 'Produced 100 messages.'"
```

You should see the following or similar output from the previous command:
```
Produced 100 messages.
```

We are going to start pyspark to use spark via python (same as we did before):

```
docker-compose exec spark pyspark
```

At the pyspark prompt, we will write some python code to consume the messages (same as we did before):

```
messages = spark \
  .read \
  .format("kafka") \
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:29092") \
  .option("subscribe","foo") \
  .option("startingOffsets", "earliest") \
  .option("endingOffsets", "latest") \
  .load() 
```

The same command on 1 line to make it easy to copy and paste:
```
numbers = spark.read.format("kafka").option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:29092").option("subscribe","foo").option("startingOffsets", "earliest").option("endingOffsets", "latest").load() 
```

Print the schema for the data frame (same as we did before).
```
messages.printSchema()
```

Show the messages.  Note that they values are in binary, which humans have a hard time reading:
```
messages.show()
```

Since we have a hard time reading binary for the value, let's translate the key and value into strings so we can read them.  Create a new data fram which stores the numbers as strings.  Note the data frames are immutable, so we cannot change them in place, we have to make a copy:
```
messages_as_strings=messages.selectExpr("CAST(key AS STRING)", "CAST(value AS STRING)")
```

Use some of the methods of the data frame to display various things:

Display the entire data frame.  Note that we can now read the key and value:
```
messages_as_strings.show()
```

Display the schema for the data frame:
```
messages_as_strings.printSchema()
```

Display the number of items in the data frame:
```
messages_as_strings.count()
```

Let's look at "unrolling" the json data.

Use the take method to extract individual data from json.  Try the following and see what they do:
```
messages_as_strings.select('value').take(1)
messages_as_strings.select('value').take(1)[0].value
```

One mistake that people who are new to spark make is knowing when to use the spark parallel methods and when to use the python core and/or pandas methods.  If we are going to manipulate an entire data frame (or RDD) we should use parallel methods.  Using python core or pandas methods on large data frames defeats the purpose of using spark in the first place.  If we are going to manipulate 1 record or a small number of records, we should use python core or pandas.  

In the following example, we are extracting 1 json object from the spark data frame.  In this case we want to use python core to manipulate it since it's only 1 record.

```
import json
```

```
first_message=json.loads(messages_as_strings.select('value').take(1)[0].value)
```

```
first_message
```

```
print(first_message['commit']['committer']['name'])
```

Should see the following output:
```
Nico Williams
```

Exit pyspark using the well formed method:
```
exit()
```

Tear down the docker cluster:
```
docker-compose down
```
