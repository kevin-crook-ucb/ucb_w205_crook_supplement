If you need to attend my other section, you may do so using the Zoom link I post in the slack channel.  You don't need to ask permission, but I ask that you voluntarily try to limit it to a max of 3 times per semester.

### Office Hours:

```
Monday and Tuesday

Following class at 5:30 pm, although classes may run over a few minutes.

I still always stay until 6:30 pm.  If student are still present with questions at 6:30 pm, I will stay.  If it's after 6:30 pm and the last student has left, I will end my office hours.

If it's not your class, use the Zoom link I post in the slack channel.
