# Project 3 Setup

- You're a data scientist at a game development company.  
- Your latest mobile game has two events you're interested in tracking: 
- `buy a sword` & `join guild`...
- Each has metadata

## Project 3 Task
- Your task: instrument your API server to catch and analyze these two
event types.
- This task will be spread out over the last four assignments (9-12).

# Assignment 09

## Follow the steps we did in class 
- for both the simple flask app and the more complex one.

### Turn in your `/assignment-09-<user-name>/README.md` file. It should include:
1) A summary type explanation of the example. 
  * For example, for Week 6's activity, a summary would be: "We spun up a cluster with kafka, zookeeper, and the mids container. Then we published and consumed messages with kafka."
2) Your `docker-compose.yml`
3) Source code for the flask application(s) used.
4) Each important step in the process. For each step, include:
  * The command(s) 
  * The output (if there is any).  Be sure to include examples of generated events when available.
  * An explanation for what it achieves 
    * The explanation should be fairly detailed, e.g., instead of "publish to kafka" say what you're publishing, where it's coming from, going to etc.
