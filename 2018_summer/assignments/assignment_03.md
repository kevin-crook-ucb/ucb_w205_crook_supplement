# Query Project

- In the Query Project, you will get practice with SQL while learning about
  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. You'll answer business-driven
  questions using public datasets housed in GCP. To give you experience with
  different ways to use those datasets, you will use the web UI (BiqQuery) and
  the command-line tools, and work with them in jupyter notebooks.

- We will be using the Bay Area Bike Share Trips Data
  (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/bay-bike-share). 

#### Problem Statement
- You're a data scientist at Ford GoBike (https://www.fordgobike.com/), the
  company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and
  you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. What deals do you
  offer though? Currently, your company has three options: a flat price for a
  single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24
  hours and an annual membership. 

- Through this project, you will answer these questions: 
  * What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"?
  * What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?


## Assignment 03 - Querying data from the BigQuery CLI - set up 

### What is Google Cloud SDK?
- Read: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/overview

- If you want to go further, https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/concepts has
  lots of good stuff.

### Get Going

- Install Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/

- Try BQ from the command line:

  * General query structure

    ```
    bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
        SELECT count(*)
        FROM
           `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`'
    ```

### Queries

1. Rerun last week's queries using bq command line tool (Paste your bq
   queries):

- What's the size of this dataset? (i.e., how many trips)

- What is the earliest start time and latest end time for a trip?

- How many bikes are there?

2. New Query (Paste your SQL query and answer the question in a sentence):

- How many trips are in the morning vs in the afternoon?
